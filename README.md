StackADT
========
The StackADT package, like the queue package, creates a new stack in which pet owners, pet names, and pet id's are stored. With the basic functions of a stack being the last in, first out function, the PetGUI utilizes its push, pop, peek, and isEmpty accordingly. The push function allows a user to push in a new pet item. (Owner, Name, Id) The pop function allows the user to remove the last input pet item. The peek function allows a user to view all items in the pet stack.
